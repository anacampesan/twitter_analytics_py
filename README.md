# Twitter Timeline Data Analytics

This algorithm lets you grab some data from your Twitter timeline and find out:
* where you friends are tweeting from, and
* what languages they're tweeting in.

Just install the dependencies from the requirements file, insert your twitter tokens, and
run the script.

```python
python get_timeline.py
```
